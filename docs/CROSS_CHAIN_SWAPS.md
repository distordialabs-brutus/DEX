# Cross-chain swaps: implementation and operating boundary

The **Cross-chain swaps** tab replaces the old single-provider prototype. It is separate from the native Nexus order book. These are **operator-custodied transfers, not atomic or trustless swaps**.

## Current release status

**Implemented client and opt-in service receipt protocol; funding is not release-enabled.** Discovery, provider inspection, and exact quotes work without an accepted funding deployment. Current Nexus Interface has an additional storage-capability blocker described below. No live transfers, production activation, wallet installation, commits, or pushes are part of this change.

`src/swap/deployment.js` deliberately has an empty `ACCEPTED_DEPLOYMENTS` array. Do not populate it merely because offline tests pass. Existing service-side production blockers, including the previously documented daily-cap bypass, are not repaired by a UI or receipt change.

## Why a custom Solana wallet is unnecessary

An ordinary wallet **Send** form and a wallet's **dApp signing API** are different interfaces. A missing memo field in the former does not prevent the latter from signing a transaction containing an SPL Token transfer and a memo instruction.

| Alternative | Decision |
|---|---|
| Injected Phantom / Solflare dApp signing | Implemented. DEX constructs `TransferChecked` and the exact memo together; the external wallet retains keys and prompts for approval. |
| Bundled external-browser signer | Implemented fallback for Nexus Electron WebViews, which may not expose browser extensions. DEX opens its bundled `dist/solana-sign.html` in the user's browser. No remote signing website is selected by the provider. |
| Solana Pay transfer URI | Researched, pure URI helper tested, **not enabled as a funding shortcut**. It requires the vault to equal the owner's associated token account, correct mint, memo support and mainnet policy. A normal URI does not safely select devnet/testnet. |
| Wallet-specific mobile deep links / remote wallet connectors | Possible future integrations; would require separate connection/session/security and wallet acceptance work. Not silently substituted. |
| Private-key import or embedded custodial Solana wallet | Not added. It would create unnecessary key storage, backup, signing and custody liabilities. |

### Signing companion

The URL fragment contains only allowlisted public job data: exact units, provider/token/vault identity, recipient, network, reference and expiry. It contains no PIN, session, seed phrase, private key or provider-supplied RPC URL. Public data still includes transaction/account privacy information; do not share the link unnecessarily.

The signer uses reviewed static RPC/network policy, checks mint/vault/source account ownership, balances, freeze state and decimals, and constructs a fresh transaction. It does not deserialize and sign an arbitrary supplied transaction. It rejects changed fragments and expired jobs. A per-job Web Lock and a verified local attempt record precede wallet submission. A timeout remains uncertain; there is no automatic retry. A stored signature is recovered on reload and can be copied back to DEX for finalized transfer verification.

This attempt protection is browser-origin-local, **not a global exactly-once guarantee across devices or cleared browser storage**. Never reopen an uncertain funding intent in another browser to try sending again.

## User flow on an accepted, compatible deployment

1. Select the Solana network and discover providers or enter an exact Nexus provider register address.
2. DEX re-reads the selected record and resolves actual token/custody accounts and decimals. It does not silently fall back to USDC, USDD or a fixed operator.
3. Choose direction, exact input text and owned Nexus token account. For Nexus-to-Solana, enter an existing SPL token account for the selected mint, not a wallet-owner address.
4. Review exact input, fee and output units, operator identity and custodial risk. Save the immutable job before funding.
5. Solana-to-Nexus: open the browser signer, approve in Phantom/Solflare, then return the signature. DEX verifies finalized transfer/memo evidence before waiting for output.
6. Nexus-to-Solana: approve the exact debit through the Nexus wallet's PIN dialog. DEX distinguishes the user's DEBIT from the provider's confirmed CREDIT. Routing publication binds the provider CREDIT transaction and the reviewed Solana destination.
7. Check payout evidence. Solana output requires the exact provider vault/mint, recipient, units and composite memo `nexus_txid:<provider-credit-txid>:<contract-id>`.
8. Nexus output is discovered through the source-signature receipt. DEX checks the provider-owned receipt, exact Nexus payout DEBIT and a sufficiently confirmed recipient CREDIT. A pending claim is not spendable completion: use the Nexus wallet's Receive/notification workflow and check again.

Every recovery operation is evidence-based. A bounded empty scan, a balance increase, a memo substring or a successful-looking status string is not settlement. Exported public evidence aids manual investigation; it is not authority to resend or mark a job complete.

## Required Nexus Interface storage capability

Source inspection of Nexus Interface `master` found `updateStorage([data])` calling `writeModuleStorage(activeModule, data)` without awaiting or returning durable completion. The old module SDK's `updateStorage` is a fire-and-forget API. Wrapping it in `Promise.resolve(...)` would manufacture an acknowledgement and is **not safe**.

DEX therefore distinguishes ordinary settings saves from the financial journal:

- Existing settings still use `NEXUS.utilities.updateStorage` and retain legacy behavior.
- Financial journal writes require the **proposed host extension** `NEXUS.utilities.updateStorageAcknowledged(data)`.
- That name is an explicit future integration contract, **not a claim that current Nexus Interface or `nexus-module` already provides it**.
- The host implementation must atomically persist the correct module's full data, enforce its size limit, finish durable filesystem persistence and resolve only then; it must reject errors and avoid success after a module/profile-context switch. Host-side serialization must preserve ordering across modules/windows as appropriate.
- A resolved `false`, error, missing method, missing Web Locks, storage failure or corrupt journal blocks financial mutation. No unacknowledged fallback funds a swap.
- The user explicitly limited this task to DEX and swapService; Nexus Interface was not modified or installed.

Until this capability is implemented and tested in the target wallet, current wallets remain **inspection-only for new swap jobs**, even if an operator acceptance record were configured. Existing public job data can still be inspected. See [Nexus Interface WebView handler source](https://github.com/Nexusoft/NexusInterface/blob/master/src/shared/lib/modules/webview.js).

## Service receipt extension

The sibling `swapService` now has opt-in `NEXUS_SWAP_RECEIPTS_ENABLED` (default false). New recommended-v1 registrations can advertise the immutable optional field:

```text
receipt_schema=nexus-swap-receipt-v1
```

An existing registration without this creation-time field must be replaced deliberately; a heartbeat update does not invent immutable fields. No existing registration was updated during this work.

After exact confirmed Nexus payout evidence, the service atomically records an outbox obligation with terminal payout bookkeeping. Receipt publication does not authorize, retry, refund or modify money movement. Each asset create is durably claimed first and is never blindly repeated after timeout. Publication requires exact owner/field/address read-back.

The receipt is an `assets/create/asset` JSON schema with all data fields immutable (`mutable: false`). Built-in Nexus `owner` is never supplied as a custom field. It binds:

- `distordiaType=nexusSwapReceipt`, `schema=nexus-swap-receipt-v1`;
- full `source_signature`, `solana_mint`, `solana_vault`;
- `nexus_token`, `nexus_account`;
- `output_txid`, canonical `output_contract_id`, integer `output_units`, and the service's actual `reference`.

The sequential reference alone cannot identify the originating Solana transfer; the full-signature receipt provides that link. See the sibling service's `ASSET_STANDARD.md` and `src/swap_receipts.py`.

## Architecture

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `providers.js` | Bounded discovery, recommended-v1 validation, address read-back, liveness and immutable term comparison. Unsupported/explicit future schemas fail closed. |
| `money.js` | BigInt unit parsing, decimal conversion, fee/minimum calculation and deterministic rounding. No floating-point funding arithmetic. |
| `nexus.js` | Real Nexus API payloads and exact source, routing, receipt, DEBIT/CREDIT proof. |
| `solana.js` | Installed SDK transaction construction, classic SPL account validation and finalized transfer/memo proof. |
| `jobs.js`, `controller.js` | Scoped immutable journal, serialized intent-first state transitions and no-resubmit recovery. |
| `persistence.js`, `configureStore.js` | Shared ordered storage coordinator; acknowledged financial writes and compatible legacy settings saves. |
| `runtime.js` | Adapter composition, fresh scope/provider/pair/quote validation and public signing handoff. |
| `deployment.js` | Static network/genesis allowlist and per-deployment acceptance/dust gates. Never loaded from provider-controlled data. |
| `signingPage.js`, `dist/solana-sign.html` | Non-custodial external-browser signing surface. |
| `stablecoinSwap.js` | Provider selection, review, wallet handoff, job history and recovery controls. |

Normal progress:

```text
Solana → Nexus: draft → awaiting_signature → awaiting_payout → completed
Nexus → Solana: draft → submission_unknown → debit_submitted
                    → awaiting_service_credit → mapping_unknown → awaiting_payout → completed
```

Unknown states are durable holds, not failures/refunds. Only drafts can be cancelled. Default Nexus finality is six confirmations and is frozen before funding; a stronger job policy is not lowered on resume.

## Verification and release checklist

Local commands (Node with built-in test runner/Web Crypto; development verified on the installed Node toolchain):

```bash
npm test
npm run lint:swap
npm run build
```

`npm test` currently runs the **swap suite**, not every pre-existing application feature or the dormant Jest configuration. Full-repository lint debt is reported separately; dependency upgrades remain deferred for Nexus Interface compatibility.

Before enabling any exact deployment:

- [ ] Implement and validate the acknowledged storage capability in the target Nexus wallet, including restart/crash and size-limit failures.
- [ ] Verify installed module serving/open-in-browser URLs, browser wallet injection, supported Web Locks, and persisted origins.
- [ ] Exercise both directions on actual Nexus testnet and Solana devnet/testnet with configured tokens, all fees, minima/dust and sufficient liquidity.
- [ ] Verify API list/filter/pagination shapes, built-in owner exposure, DEBIT/CREDIT linkage and immutable JSON asset creation on the target node.
- [ ] Exercise wallet rejection, timeout-after-acceptance, restart, direct recovery and no duplicate submission at each financial boundary.
- [ ] Verify source-bound receipt publication, exact output and spendable Nexus claim, not just provider submission.
- [ ] Resolve remaining service production blockers and perform independent review of the exact release candidate.
- [ ] Add an acceptance record pinning provider address/owner, token/custody accounts, both networks, allowed directions, output dust floors and an actual evidence document. Rebuild both bundles together.
- [ ] Verify every manifest entry exists in the assembled module and test installation. A bundle or ZIP is not Nexus open-source-policy verification.

Do not test these boundaries with production user funds. The live release checklist remains unfulfilled by the offline fixtures.
